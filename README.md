- 👋 Hi, I’m @TandemRotors
- 👀 I’m interested in finally fulfilling my youth ambition to learn various forms of coding. I've kicked myself long enough and now I'm ready for the challenge.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. I've completed a few modules within the CodeAcademy platform, with the intent to become more and more proficident with a variety of different languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that would be beneficial for a very beginner coder. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
